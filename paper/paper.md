# Background

Graphs depicted as node-link diagrams are widely used to show relationships between entities. However, node-link diagrams comprised of a large number of nodes and edges often suffer from visual clutter. The use of edgebundling remedies this and reveals high-level edge patterns.

Force-directed Edge Bungling [@holten2009force] uses a self-organizing approach to bundling in which edges are modeled as flexible springs that can attract each other. The resulting bundled graphs show significant clutter reduction and clearly visible high-level edge patterns. Curvature variation is furthermore minimized, resulting in smooth bundles that are easy to follow.
